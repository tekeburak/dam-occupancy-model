## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The aim of this project is to develop a Dam Occupancy Rate prediction model using machine learning techniques. It is a Side Project of Udacity Bertelsmann AI Track Study Group Turkey. 

The prediction of the dam occupancy rate of the reservoirs is critical in many cases (evaluating structural problems, water supply, resource availability, navigation management, disaster prevention). 

Questions to be answered:
- Is there enough data available to develop a Dam Occupancy Rate prediction model?
- How well can we predict the dam occupancy rate of reservoirs?


## Dataset<a name="dataset"></a>

The dam occupancy rates were used as a dependent variable while reserved water, weather data were set up as the independent variables.
 
- Istanbul dam occpancy rate and dam reserved water dataset [here](https://data.ibb.gov.tr/tr/dataset/istanbul-dam-occupany-rates-data/resource/b68cbdb0-9bf5-474c-91c4-9256c07c4bdf)
- Istanbul weather dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vonline9/weather-istanbul-data-20092019)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- dam_occupancy csv file
- Istanbul_weather_data csv file
- Istanbul_5days_weather_forecast test xlsx file
- 1 jupyter notebook to showcase work related to prediction. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  
- 1 jupyter notebook for data visualization


## Analysis Process <a name="process"></a>
